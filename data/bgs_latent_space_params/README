## Example commands for opening a pickle file and accessing the data :

import pickle

% opening the pickle file
with open("BGS_full_info.pkl",'rb') as f:
	BGS = pickle.load(f)

% looking up the file's keys
BGS.keys()

% get the information from a specific key
BGS["GalaxyAE"].keys()

% looking up the quantity of information about the latent space parameters
BGS["GalaxyAE"]['latents'].shape


## TO DO:

1) get the latent space parameters from BGS_full_info.pkl and transform them into a PyTorch object; see https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/pytorch_tutorial.html for documentation

2)a) Plot the distributions for each parameter. 
  b) Make a few 2D plots showing the scatter of one parameter versus another.

3) use the scikit-learn tools for clustering (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) in order to do a clustering analysis on the latent space parameters; i.e. answer the question "can we group the galaxies into different categories given the value of their latent space parameters" ?
